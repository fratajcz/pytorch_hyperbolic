# pytorch_hyperbolic
Implementation of hyperbolic NNs and GNNs 

# Installation

```
pip install torch-hyperbolic
pip install torch-sparse
```

or 

```
git clone https://github.com/fratajcz/pytorch_hyperbolic.git
cd pytorch_hyperbolic
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.yml
```

# Usage

The individual layers can be found in ```torch_hyperbolic.nn```. For an example how they can be used, in this case for node classification, can be found in ```torch_hyperbolic.models.hgnn```. The implementation is kept very simple so that the reader can quickly identify what is going on and adapt it to his or her needs. 

A very bare-bone example of a training script can be found in ```example_train.py```, which trains a node classification task on the Cora dataset. After installation, it can be started as follows:

```
$python example_train.py

$ python example_train.py

```

As you can see, the data is downloaded and processed. Then, the model is initialized with trainable curvatures at a starting value of 1. After training for 100 Epochs, the training stops and gives us the loss on the test set.
Finally, we can see that the learned curvatures have changed. A low value close to 0 indicates a low hyperbolicity, i.e. a behaviour of the layers comparable to their euclidean counterpart, while a high curvature indicates a high hyperbolicity.
